# Hobby Graphing of IMOS Data for learning SQL, and Python Graphing
This repo is for playing around with the freely available dataset `Tracking of Short-tailed shearwaters` from AODN (Australian Ocean Data Network).
As a birder, I was especially interested in the Shearwater data.

I create a SQLite database to host the data, but note that it's not necessary- you could just read the CSV straight into a pandas data frame. I use a SQLite database just to practice working with SQL.


Data were sourced from Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) – IMOS is enabled by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). It is operated by a consortium of institutions as an unincorporated joint venture, with the University of Tasmania as Lead Agent.
